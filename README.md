# Zeke AI 🤖🛡️

Zeke AI is a privacy-conscious AI assistant built **for peer support specialists**, not their clients. It’s designed to enhance real-time Motivational Interviewing (MI), help with GPRA and BARC tracking, and support accurate, HIPAA-aligned note-taking in the field — without disrupting the human flow of peer connection.

Whether you're supporting someone in crisis, documenting a session, or preparing wellness plans, Zeke AI empowers **you**, the peer worker, to stay present, sharp, and supported.

## 🧠 Core Philosophy

- **Peer Support Enhancement** – Not a replacement, but a supportive layer that strengthens your voice, reflections, and MI skills.
- **For Peer Specialists, By Peer Specialists** – Designed by someone with lived experience to support the people doing the emotional and spiritual labor in recovery settings.
- **Zero-Knowledge Identity** – Built to be anonymous and HIPAA-conscious from the start. No usernames, no logins, no tracking.
- **GPRA + BARC Ready** – Track key data points passively during sessions, with timestamped logs for grant compliance and backend reporting.
- **Emotional Design** – Zeke stays gentle, nonjudgmental, and recovery-minded — like a quiet assistant who’s got your back, not your job.

## 🛠️ How It Works

Zeke AI uses a smart orchestration layer called **Zeke Core**, a lightweight LLM that routes your input to different “expert agents”:

- 🧠 **MI-Coach LLM** — Helps you reflect, reframe, or strengthen MI techniques in real time  
- 💬 **Note Helper LLM** — Suggests compliant, trauma-informed language for documentation  
- 🧾 **GPRA/BARC Tracker LLM** — Automatically logs answers to grant-required data fields  
- 🧭 **Resource Navigator LLM** — (Optional) Provides local recovery info on demand

Zeke Core gathers the best responses and blends them into one output — saving time, reducing burnout, and helping you serve with more presence and less paperwork.

## 🫂 About the Project

Zeke AI was created by **Andrés Chávez**, a recovery support peer specialist who believes that peers deserve the same tech support doctors and nurses get. This isn’t about replacing compassion — it’s about reinforcing it.

**Zeke is ministry meets machine. Recovery meets real-time AI.**
