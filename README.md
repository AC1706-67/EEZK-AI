## ❓ What is EEZKAI?

**EEZKAI** is an AI-powered mobile app designed to provide **anonymous peer support**, especially for individuals in recovery or needing mental health guidance.  
Built with **Zero-Knowledge principles**, users can receive support without revealing their identity—no names, no tracking, no logins.

This project was created for the World’s Largest Hackathon on [Bolt.new](https://bolt.new).

## 🧠 Advanced Architecture: Zeke Core (Routing + Synthesis)

EEZKAI includes a modular AI orchestration layer called **Zeke Core** — a small, fast LLM designed to intelligently route, coordinate, and synthesize responses from multiple specialized AI models.

- 🧭 **Routing:** Zeke Core detects the user's intent, urgency, and tone, then routes the query to one or more expert LLMs (Peer Support, Medical, Resource Navigator, etc.).
- 🧵 **Synthesis:** After gathering responses, Zeke Core combines them into a unified, human-centered reply — preserving tone, removing contradictions, and applying emotional context.

This architecture ensures EEZKAI offers **reliable, emotionally intelligent, and privacy-first responses** — grounded in recovery values while leveraging the latest in AI orchestration.

**Why it matters:**  
- Faster performance through targeted routing  
- Reduced bias by blending expert models  
- Retains human tone and dignity in all replies  
- Modular design allows future expansion with spiritual or legal agents

This is peer-centered AI that doesn’t just answer — it understands, integrates, and respects.
