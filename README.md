# 🤖 Zeke AI

Zeke AI is a privacy-conscious AI assistant built **for peer support specialists**, not their clients. It’s designed to enhance real-time Motivational Interviewing (MI), help with GPRA and BARC tracking, and support accurate, HIPAA-aligned note-taking in the field — **without disrupting the human flow of peer connection**.

Whether you're supporting someone in crisis, documenting a session, or preparing wellness plans, Zeke AI empowers **you**, the peer worker, to stay present, sharp, and supported.

## 🧠 Core Philosophy

* **Peer Support Enhancement** – Not a replacement, but a supportive layer that strengthens your voice, reflections, and MI skills.
* **For Peer Specialists, By Peer Specialists** – Designed by someone with lived experience to support the people doing the emotional and spiritual labor in recovery settings.
* **Zero-Knowledge Identity** – Built to be anonymous and HIPAA-conscious from the start. No usernames, no logins, no tracking.
* **GPRA + BARC Ready** – Track key data points passively during sessions, with timestamped logs for grant compliance and backend reporting.
* **Emotional Design** – Zeke stays gentle, nonjudgmental, and recovery-minded — like a quiet assistant who’s got your back, not your job.

---

## 🔧 How It Works

Zeke AI uses a smart orchestration layer called **Zeke Core**, a lightweight LLM that routes your input to different “expert agents”:

* 🧠 **MI-Coach LLM** – Helps you reflect, reframe, or strengthen MI techniques in real time
* 🗒️ **Note Helper LLM** – Suggests compliant, trauma-informed language for documentation
* 📋 **GPRA/BARC Tracker LLM** – Automatically logs answers to grant-required data fields
* 🌐 **Resource Navigator LLM** – (Optional) Provides local recovery info on demand

These modules work behind the scenes so you can spend less time on admin — and more time helping.

## 🎯 Personalized MI Skill Builder (New Strand)

Zeke AI includes a dedicated training strand to support **ongoing professional development**:

* Learns your MI patterns over time (e.g., reflection use, open questions)
* Recommends targeted exercises and content for **growth areas**
* Reinforces your **strengths** by suggesting mastery-level prompts
* Keeps training feedback **private and encrypted**, visible only to the coach

This is **not an evaluation tool** — it's an uplifting mirror to help peer workers grow without judgment.

## 📖 About the Project

Zeke AI was created by **Andrés Chávez**, a recovery support peer specialist who believes that peers deserve the same tech support doctors and nurses get. This isn’t about replacing compassion — it’s about reinforcing it.

**Zeke is ministry meets machine. Recovery meets real-time AI.**
